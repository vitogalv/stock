# stock
stock market simulator

The code found in this repository is part of a project that I am no longer working on. The initial idea
was to make a stock market simulator and eventually implement algorithmic trading. The stock market data is being received from
www.alphavantage.co and the code that does this can be found in the json package under data. Also in the data package is code written
that accesses a MySql database that currently stores information about different publicly traded companies. 

Why did this project hit a deadend? The main reason this project did not make it that far is because of planning. I had a rough idea of what
I wanted to make and what I wanted it to do, but I didn't put  enough work into the planning process before I started to write the code. As
a result, the project was left in the state that it is now and I moved onto other things. There was however good that did come out of this
project. I learned how to use a MySql database as well as a little bit of Java JDBC, and it got me one step closer to realizing that I should
spend more time planning what I am actually going to do.
